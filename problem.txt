Hi Candidates.

Your challenge is to scan the file provided (cases.txt) line-by-line and for each line and analyze duplicates.
This challenge should be done in a case-insensitive manner (ignore capitalization!).

Each line is a json array of strings, with some duplicates. Check if the line has at least 5 different words that occurs
at least 3 times.

For example,
["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "d", "d", "d", "e", "e", "e"] => true (5 words occuring 3+ times)
["a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "e", "e", "e"] => false (3 words occuring 3+ times)

Output:
The first line of your output should be an integer equal to the total number of true test cases in cases.txt.
After the first line you should have a line of output for each line in cases.txt, which correspondings to whether the
 line meets the requirements above. If it does have at least 5 words occuring 3+ times output "true," otherwise "false."

 So you should have 51 lines of output, the first is a number, the rest are either "true" or "false"
